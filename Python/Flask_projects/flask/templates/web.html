<li>DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.</li>
<li>Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer “siloed.” Sometimes, these two teams are merged into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle, from development and test to deployment to operations, and develop a range of skills not limited to a single function.</li>
<li>In some DevOps models, quality assurance and security teams may also become more tightly integrated with development and operations and throughout the application lifecycle. When security is the focus of everyone on a DevOps team, this is sometimes referred to as DevSecOps.
<li>These teams use practices to automate processes that historically have been manual and slow. They use a technology stack and tooling which help them operate and evolve applications quickly and reliably. These tools also help engineers independently accomplish tasks (for example, deploying code or provisioning infrastructure) that normally would have required help from other teams, and this further increases a team’s velocity.</li>

<h1 style="color: orange"> 	Amazon Web Services </h1>
<p> <font size=5> 
 
	<ul>
		<li>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. It provides a mix of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), &nbspplatform as a service (PaaS) and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings.AWS launched in 2006 from the internal infrastructure that Amazon.com built to handle its online retail operations. AWS was one of the first companies to introduce a pay-as-you-go cloud computing model that scales to provide users with compute, storage or throughput as needed.</li>

<li>Amazon Web Services provides services from dozens of data centers spread across availability zones (AZs) in regions across the world. An AZ represents a location that typically contains multiple physical data centers, while a region is a collection of AZs in geographic proximity connected by low-latency network links. An AWS customer can spin up virtual machines (VMs) and replicate data in different AZs to achieve a highly reliable infrastructure that is resistant to failures of individual servers or an entire data center.</li>

<li>More than 100 services comprise the Amazon Web Services portfolio, including those for compute, databases, infrastructure management, application development and security.</li>

<h2 style="color: orange"> 	Jenkins </h2>
<p> <font size = 5>
	<ul>
		<li>Jenkins is an open source automation tool written in Java with plugins built for Continuous Integration purpose. Jenkins is used to build and test your software projects continuously making it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project, and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh build. It also allows you to continuously deliver your software by integrating with a large number of testing and deployment technologies.</li>
		<li>With Jenkins, organizations can accelerate the software development process through automation. Jenkins integrates development life-cycle processes of all kinds, including build, document, test, package, stage, deploy, static analysis and much more.</li>
		<li>Jenkins achieves Continuous Integration with the help of plugins. Plugins allows the integration of Various DevOps stages. If you want to integrate a particular tool, you need to install the plugins for that tool. For example: Git, Maven 2 project, Amazon EC2, HTML publisher etc.</li>
			<p style="color: orange;" > <font size=5>What is Continuous Integration? 
</font></p>

        <li>Continuous Integration is a development practice in which the developers are required to commit changes to the source code in a shared repository several times a day or more frequently. Every commit made in the repository is then built. This allows the teams to detect the problems early. Apart from this, depending on the Continuous Integration tool, there are several other functions like deploying the build application on the test server, providing the concerned teams with the build and test results etc</li>
        <p style="color: orange;" > <font size=5>What is Continuous Delivery? 
</font></p>

<div>
        <img src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Continuous-Delivery-Continuous-Delivery-Edureka.png" width="500" height="300"/>
    </div>
         <li> Automated build scripts will detect changes in Source Code Management (SCM) like Git.Once the change is detected, source code would be deployed to a dedicated build server to make sure build is not failing and all test classes and integration tests are running fine.Then, the build application is deployed on the test servers (pre-production servers) for User Acceptance Test (UAT).Finally, the application is manually deployed on the production servers for release.</li>
          <p style="color: orange;" > <font size=5>Differences Between Continuous Integration, Delivery And Deployment: 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size=5>
        <li>In Continuous Integration, every code commit is build and tested, but, is not in a condition to be released. I mean the build application is not automatically deployed on the test servers in order to validate it using different types of Blackbox testing like – User Acceptance Testing (UAT).</li>
        <li>In Continuous Delivery, the application is continuously deployed on the test servers for UAT. Or, you can say the application is ready to be released to production anytime. So, obviously Continuous Integration is necessary for Continuous Delivery.</li>
        <li>Continuous Deployment is the next step past Continuous Delivery, where you are not just creating a deployable package, but you are actually deploying it in an automated fashion.</li>
         <li>Continuous Integration	Continuous Delivery	Continuous DeploymentAutomated build for every, commit	Automated build and UAT for every, commit	Automated build, UAT and release to production for every, commitIndependent of Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment	It is the next step after Continuous Integration	it is one step further Continuous DeliveryBy the end, the application is not in a condition to be released to production	By the end, the application is in a condition to be released to the production.

<h3 style="color: orange"> 	Docker </h3>
<p style="color: orange;" > <font size=5> What is Docker & Docker Container ? 
</font></p>
    
	<p><font size=5>
    <ul>
	<li>What is Docker ? – Docker is a containerization platform that packages your application and all its dependencies together in the form of a docker container to ensure that your application works seamlessly in any environment.</li>
	<li>What is Container ? – Docker Container is a standardized unit which can be created on the fly to deploy a particular application or environment. It could be an Ubuntu container, CentOs container, etc. to full-fill the requirement from an operating system point of view. Also, it could be an application oriented container like CakePHP container or a Tomcat-Ubuntu container etc.</li>
	<p style="color: orange;" > <font size=5>Let’s understand it with an example: 
    </font></p>
    <li>A company needs to develop a Java Application. In order to do so the developer will setup an environment with tomcat server installed in it. Once the application is developed, it needs to be tested by the tester. Now the tester will again set up tomcat environment from the scratch to test the application. Once the application testing is done, it will be deployed on the production server. Again the production needs an environment with tomcat installed on it, so that it can host the Java application. If you see the same tomcat environment setup is done thrice</li>
    <li>There are some issues that I have listed below with this approachThere is a loss of time and effort. There could be a version mismatch in different setups i.e. the developer & tester may have installed tomcat 7, however the system admin installed tomcat 9 on the production server. Now, I will show you how Docker container can be used to prevent this loss. In this case, the developer will create a tomcat docker image ( A Docker Image is nothing but a blueprint to deploy multiple containers of the same configurations ) using a base image like Ubuntu, which is already existing in Docker Hub (Docker Hub has some base docker images available for free) . Now this image can be used by the developer, the tester and the system admin to deploy the tomcat environment. This is how docker container solves the problem.I hope you are now clear on What is Docker & Docker Container. In case you have any further doubts, please feel to leave a comment, I will be glad to help you.However, now you would think that this can be done using Virtual Machines as well. However, there is catch if you choose to use virtual machine</li>
